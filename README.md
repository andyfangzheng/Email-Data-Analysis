# Email-Data-Analysis
In this case we are going to use sklearn pacakge to do email classification: ham (non-junk mail)and spam(junk mail)
We go through all the mails of all users in folder "inbox" and "deleted_items", which is already classified by the users.
We use k-flod cross validation, using part of the dataset as training set and the rest as testing, and finally gain the accuracy
